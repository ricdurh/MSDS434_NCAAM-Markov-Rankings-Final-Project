# NCAAM-Markov-Rankings-Final-Project

This application creates an NCAAM team ranking using the 2018 NCAAM season data in Google BigQuery. The ranking is created using a Logistic Regression Markov Chain model similar to what was used in [this](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jsokol/ncaa.pdf) 2006 paper by Paul Kvam and Joel Sokol.
